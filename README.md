# Simple Payroll
Simple Payroll is a command line application written in C# made to create text based payslips.

# Instructions
Provide a txt file called "staff.txt" in the same directory as the application. This will hold all the staff member names and roles to generate the payslips. Write the names in the following format: 
```
Yvonne, Manager
Peter, Manager
John, Admin
Carol, Admin
```

Once the staff.txt has the names and roles of all the employees, simply run the application and fill out the information as prompted. It should look like the following:

Individual payslips and a summary file will be created in the same directory as the application.
